# Retlang.Net

Message based concurrency in .NET

Retlang is a high performance C# threading library (see Jetlang for a version in Java). 
The library is intended for use in message based concurrency similar to event based actors in Scala. 
The library does not provide remote messaging capabilities. It is designed specifically for high performance in-memory messaging.
